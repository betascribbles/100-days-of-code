### Day 1: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech, ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on putting a few of my code trials on Codepen. The one below I developed from Wes Bros' 30daysofJavaScript. It was a really valuable course and I learnt so much from it. This pen combines a few of the classes in one as well as being based on a programme (pizza order) that I built at the start of my JavaScript course at Indisoft.

**Thoughts**: Alongside the above I also continued with the Machine Learning course and at the day course learn the basics of PHP. I am really enjoying coding so much but finding the hour for 100DaysofCode for me is most useful for keeping on top of Documentation and keeping my projects in check - super valuable!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: At my daytime class I did alot of PHP on Udemy which felt good but shot my mind alittle. This afternoon I completed Machine Learning week 4 and started the codeacademy Data Science track. I also did a couple of Code war Kata today and a little freecode camp as mental breaks from the PHP.

**Thoughts** Intense day on PHP but very happy with the process! Also have split out a couple of features from my vocab trainer onto codepen so I can edit these features.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the PHP & SQL part of the course I was following and starting an example for a Book Club app I spent the afternoon adapting the Pong game I made last year into a Birthday gift for a friend. Link below. Working with the audio inside the loops was quite tricky and it is a little buggy but hopefully he likes it. As we're out to Dinner tonight and I have an appointment this afternoon I doubt I will get much more done but hope to do a little more code academy Data Science.

**Thoughts** Ok kind of slacked off working on this game for my friend but it was a little tricky in part and good to revisit old code to see how far I have come. I plan to move a few of my private Bitbucket Repos over to Github this weekend so I have more to show there.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:Today I put that PHP knowledge to practice, after transfering data from my JSON file to my database (see previous post) I started to manipulate the page and get some simple design elements in. St

Not feeling overly well so had a mid afternoon nap and read a little of Interactive Data Visualisation This evening I have been continuing through the code academy Data Science Beta track learning Matplotlib for python. 

**Thoughts** Pretty excited for the potential of the PHP I have learnt and being able to apply it to both the Book Club App I have started and my on going Vocab Trainer. I am debating trying to make the Book Club app using React also to demonstrate and practice those skills, I believe it will be a good (tough) challenge and give me a chance to showcase library use) Though I intend to keep the Vocab Trainer Vanilla JS.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most the afternoon trying to get Anaconda with python 3 and Jupyter Notebook running properly on my machine. At the last Meetup I went to I had a bit of a personal crisis as I had last minute updated or installed something which stopped me from being able to open Jupyter Notebook and therefore participate in the code along lecture on Unsupervised learning. However once I got this up and running I could put into practice the MatPlotLib classes from Codeacademy and draw some charts :)

**Thoughts** Feeling happy now after fixing this, but frustrated most of the afternoon, however the work has paid off. Now I'm going for a much earnt bath with my book!!

### Day 7: January 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I had a bit of a day off and took some time for chores and reading the Book for my Book Club. I did however complete the next section on the Codeacademy Data Science Track. 

**Thoughts** Week one complete! Feeling like I accomplished alot and looking forwards to the next 93 days :)

### Day 8: January 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent pretty much all day split between setting up my PHP and working with React. I'm pretty keen to incorporate the JS library in my Book Club app as it will show use of a library in my portfolio and is used for a lot of web apps UI. I have been following along a Udacity course on Progressive Web Apps and try to model my App of that also as I find coding along and then applying it to my own work a good set up personally. Lots of time on Stack overflow today...thank goodness for that website! Yet to need to post as I mostly have found answers but I am having a problem with my AJAX requests so after another look at it tomorrow I may have to hit the forums!

**Thoughts** It was an intense day of mainly going back and forth and not a huge sense of achievement at the end of it, though I am sure it will be worth it in the end! Otherwise I have put a few of my repositories on Github now so they are public apose to the ones I currently have on Bitbucket. Tomorrow I am going to Tech Women Meetup which I am looking forwards to and hope to be a bit futher with my Apps!

### Day 9: January 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I signed up to Codewars about a month ago but from today I am trying to doing one Kata per day in JS. Honestly the benefit of taking time out from tutorial and apps I’m building to work on a small(ish) coding challenge is huge! T

Now I am off the Women Tech Makers Berlin Meetup at Native Instruments where they are having a group of talks about working in development for music apps, not per say my field but hopefully a chance to meet some new faces.

Until tomrorow!

**Thoughts** The Meetup was great 3 staff members from Native Instruments discussed their roles in the company and what their looked to achieve within their department but also as a company and product. They were pretty candid about how the Berlin office is not very diverse but talked about how they hoped to improve it. Katy Peichart the head of Recruitment talked about how she believes when your recruiting if you don't have a diverse candiancy pool then you should look to fix that not shrug it of. I couldnt agree more and I find it super refreshing to find a recruiter with this atitude.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App wired up with PHP finally! Woohoo! worked a little on the design also, I want to have the cards where you train similar to children langauge learning cards. I also styled Book Club app and got more under the hood with React - still alot to learn there. I am concerned how I will fix this up with PHP and also if that's the right route but not sure it is smart to take on another techknology right now. Lastly or rather firstly as I did this first thing this morning I completed a Kata and wrote a blog post about my approach( link below). I found the process really rewarding and it helped sink in the methods I used.

**Thoughts** 10% through and feeling reflective, it's been a great 10 days and I feel very positive about this experience and the energy I have at the moment. I just hope to keep the momentum. Talking last night with other developers ta the meetup was a chance to try out talking about my expereince and career goals. Still early days and need to be a little more focused but enjoying it immensly.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App using the service worker to store data in the local cach and work somewhat offline! Big step forwards but revealed a million bugs ^^ still happy with this progress I think roughing in these techknologies will save me from going back later an dhaving to make more changes. I also put this site up on Github Pages although cirrently it does not link up the PHP and is fairly buggy, still I am able to view it on my phone which is a great (though a little disappointing) insight into its performance. (Lots to work on :) )

**Thoughts** It was another day of going through documentation and various courses to piece together what I wanted but I was successful which was a nice feeling. I have also updated the look alittle of the Vocab Cards which has been satifying although a small win. The below helped alot today to get it clear in my head about service workers, I also looked at the Udacity courses but found they left too large of gaps for me but the code examples were good.

https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0

**Link(s) to work**:  Through github pages you can view my app here, thought it is currently very Buggy and not hooking up to the PHP it gives me a starting point for changing the layout and useability and actually access it on my phone.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on tidying up what I had been working on this week on both my apps. I did a couple of codewar Kata and a bit more of www.freecodecamp.org/ (I'm up to the Basic Algorithm Scripting). In the evening I had a friend over for dinner so I didn't get any additional coding done.

**Thoughts** Good end of week tie up and thinking about the next couple of weeks. I have three months left at Indisoft so I need to plan out how I am using this time. My goal is to get both apps up to a polished version in the first month and then focus on more PHP SQL learning with a view for data anaylsis and visualisation.

### Day 13: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got through Week 5 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera.org. It is focusing on Neural Network Learning and Backpropagation. I definitley find this course challenging, the concepts are absolutely fancinating but the Maths is alittle above (perhaps even alot although I don't feel totally lost) my level. However I am perservering because I am enjoying it and  I think it will give me some key concepts and algorithm but I will definietly need more study on this subject. I did however find these great videos for the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&app=desktop

**Thoughts** Definitely feeling a little like I am scraping by with the machine learning but I am enjoying it immensly and looking forwards to seeing where the course goes in terms of implementation examples.

### Day 14: January 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: This morning I focused on working through the week 5 programing challange from Machine Learning on coursera and then continued on through codeacademy data science Beta Track, almost done which I'm happy about, I then need to put in some time tomorrow checking my set up as Tuesday I have the Meetup on Tensor Flow.

**Thoughts** I took a bit of the weekend for reading and spending some time away from the computer which I think is important for balance and definitely feeling refreshed for the week ahead!

### Day 15: January 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today during the day I focused on implementing my different lists (categories) in the Vocab App, I got this mostly completed today including have offline lists and locally stored ones. Tomorrow I need to work on being able to create new lists. Currently I am emulating the local ones so I can keep refreshing the code and cache. In the afternoon I focused on going through my Python notes and trying to complete the Tensorflow, unfortunately it has not been working and I will have to finish it tomorrow before the PyLadies Meetup.

**Thoughts** It was a progressive day for working on my App and I need to keep this flow up so I can finish it in the next four weeks :)

### Day 16: January 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I managed to fix the fetch request bug this morning I needed to load my js within a then attached to the then that added the .html file into the html innertext. This way it was definitely loaded after the html is loaded! I also spent about 1.5 hours on a level 4 Kata but it was a bit too tricky for me, I will return to it. I dinished the lists implementation. This afternoon I completed installing the Tensorflow enviroment, it turned out Tensor flow does not work with Anaconda 32 bit and I had to uninstall everything and reinstall. I managed in the nick of time! The Meetup was great, Irina was a great instructor and incredibly patient to get everyone up and running. She gave a great introduction and insight to CNN as well as Tensorboard. I really enjoed this session and chatting with the other attendees.

**Thoughts** Really productive day but a long one, now very sleepy! zzzzzzz

### Day 17: January 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent the afternoon refreshing my Python knowledge and getting my set up enviroment ready for use. I am planning to delve much more into using Python outside of Indisoft, prodominetly through Jupyter Notebooks but I also want to be more familiar with it in general. I am learning through PluralSight I have tried most learning resources online and found PluralSight the most comprehension, naturally some teachers are more engaging than others but overall their content is more thorough and indepth. With also intermediate and advanced courses I hope it will help me know level up from basics to professional.

**Thoughts** Happy to go back over these funamentals and refresh the language, very much needed and will help me move forward with the Data Science courses I have been taking.

### Day 18: January 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: VUE (Visual understanding Enviroment)  http://vue.tufts.edu  is a brilliant *free* software for mindmapping and diagraming workflows, functions anything you can think of. I used it today to replace original paper notes and concrete down how my App flows and how the UX is. I am also using it to explain my functions visually and things such as Scoring. 

I also started today to rough in the styling for when the keyboard is up when the user is inputing in a text field. Still alittle unsure of my soultion but this gives you an idea of what I am thinking. It essentially combines checking if an input is in focus, if yes it then checks if the VH has been reduced to less than 350, if this is the case it implements the .keyboardUp class to move unnesscary elements off screen.

This evening I continued on with Plural Sights Python Fundamentals, it's great! I also came across this Youtube Series for Machine Learning with Python which I plan to go through after I am further into the fundamentals.

**Thoughts** Honestly today I felt alittle blocked with my app on what to work on (although there is still a lot to go) instead of forcing it I decided to take a fresh approach with the mapping and diagrams which kept me thinking about the project and gave me some new ideas having looked at a different angles. I also went through the Freecodecamp JavaScript basic algorithms and a handful of Codewars Kata which I will blog about tomorrow.

### Day 19: January 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: After finishing mapping out all the scripts, functions and variables (blue are constants and green muttable variables) it is clear I need to organise the app much better and start refractoring this code into objects and modules. 

**Thoughts** In one way this is shocking how messy my code is, however on the other hand its been a great process and valuable to see the app spread out like this. I intend to then push these into class diagrams using draw.io.

### Day 20: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I did the first half of this weeks Machine Learning course, the second half I will do tomorrow. Otherwise it's been a non code focused Day. I skyped with a friend in the states this morning about meeting in Canada later this year, had a consultation for a tattoo (my first) I will have on Tuesday, more on this to follow ^^ and met friends who have just returned from travelling in Australia. All round a super day but a little less coding than normal. Still at least 5 hours though, tomorrow I plan to put a little more time.

**Thoughts** The machine learning is so fascinating but definitely needs a lot of concentration and therefore a little draining in big chunks but by splitting it up and digesting it more slowly I am finding it is going in better :) I also spoke with my Grandparents ( who I will visit in Canada) as it was my Grandads 89th birthday!

### Day 21: January 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finshed this weeks Machine Learning course. (week 6) It was great to be able to implement some of the previous learnt knowledge to complete the programing challenge. Unfortunately in the afternoon my computer crashed and will not reboot. Luckily after I had completed all the Machine Learning but still concerning as my Data is on there and I had unfortuately not backed it up yet :( Hopefully can get it working again tomorrow.

**Thoughts** The Machine Learning course is really challenging me but I am super enjoying it! I definitely will take more classes like this after completing this one, though I will finish this before making another commitment.

### Day 22: January 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: The computer is still broken :'( Total nightmare. At least during the day I am working on my Vocab App and also taking a little time for codewars.com Kata. You can see my progress on mapping out my functions below. I have almost converted all the different JS files into objects on the main.js file. I will complete this tomorrow.

**Thoughts** It looks like I will need to completely wipe and reinstall windows. I plan to buy a external hard drive to use in the future not just for Data back up but also to make a partition for running virtual enviroments.

### Day 23: January 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: So far completed the function to Objects conversion and started to fine tune some of the functions within those Objects. Also leveled up on codewars.com, I'm now a 5 kyū yellow belt Woop Woop! This afternoon I hope to get the computer up and running again and start the process of reinstalling everything!

**Thoughts** Not having a working computer at home is a total nightmare, I set up my Alexa last night as I would like to do the code academy course on programming it. Just need to get the computer working first.....

### Day 24 - 31: January 24 - 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:The end of January has been a bit of diaster because of my laptop and home machine breaking. I decided to spend all the time coding while at school and have therefore not updated this blog but rest assured plenty of coding every day. Meaning quite a lot of changes on my Vocab App! Below is the link to my journal where I have attached a few screen shots and explained how I have updated the design.

**Thoughts** Very bummed out not having a working computer. The new one I got last friday then had an error with one of the USB ports and has had to be returned, fingers crossed the next one comes before the weekend so I can start coding again!! Here's to a more successful February! <3

### Day 32: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: One design choice I made this week was that there will be no Desktop (Larger Screen) version of this App. Instead following the same URL the user will be taken to a page that displays how I made the app including a live version displayed in a iframe. At the moment this is achieved through an iframe which is only displayed if the screen is over 1050px (through a media query) however this is fairly laggy! So I will have to rethink this approach. It seems it somehow also messes with my Ajax calls though I am not completely sure what is bugging here, I will have to check. I have set this up through the gitHub pages so you can alreadys see it in action - though the development section is not progressed very far.


**Thoughts** The “Webpage” version of this Web App will provide information on what technologies are used, design examples, UX maps, sample code and of course a short explanation with user stories which I have aimed to meet. Honestly I think this is better than having a larger view of the App as I mainly plan to showcase this programme as a portfolio piece.

### Day 33: February 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fridays are my day for cleaning code, checking and adding comments. However today as I am getting to a first completion stage I have also got to the point to where the full implementation of the local storage needed to be completed. This turned out a little more complex than I had initiallly thought and changed up my idea of how I will collect the Data and when the user sends info to the database and when they get it. I actually think this process is super beneficial and will help me with my future Data Base projects. In the atfernoon I completed the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng Week 8 up until the programming challenge. My new laptop arrived and all seems to be working! Which is great so I am looking forwards to getting everything installed and up and running!

**Thoughts** Hoping the new set up will help me push forwards with my productivity, I am very keen to learn more Python and Data Science and put into practice what I have learnt so far int hese techknologies.

### Day 34: February 3, 2018 

Today was spent completing the Programmming challenge for Machine Learning week 8. The challenge put in to practice K-means clustering and Unsupervised Learning and also PCA. Afterwards I need a little more of the MIT Linear Algebra Course.

**Thoughts** Really enjoying the Machine Learning course and I have also seen a number of other interesting resources for when this course is finished. This was definitely a big commitment and some weeks I have struggled getting it finished on time, so I need to be sure not to take too much on at once.

### Day 35: February 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time on the MIT linear Algebra and also a little time tidying up my online presence at Github, twitter, linkedIn etc. 

**Thoughts** I've found it important to take some days every so often to access what I have achieved so far and make sure everything is well represented and still accessible.

### Day 36: February 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I wired up the IndexedDB database so it is saving in the correct format to local storage, this had taken a little more change that I had anticipated as I realised it was better to save my categories as items in one table, each having it's list name as one property and a second property consisting of an array containing the word objects. It set me up well to start fixing the PHP and MySQL side for server saved categories. Well worth the time put in, next I will need to make it so the user can download lists from the Server and save them across to the local storage but first I need to complete the PHP requests!

**Thoughts** Doing this has given me new insight into DB architecture and I think after this project I will be better equiped for working on the Book Club App again with more PHP.

<a name="day37"></a>
### Day 37: February 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the PHP integration, I also built in the function to download from the server and save to the local. This works really well actually and was alot of fun to do. It requires a few promises for timing and these are a little buggy I noticed so I will have to look more in to how promises work and make sure I can fix it.

When the site is visited on a large screen it will point to a development page explaining the App and the technologies used. Today I started to flesh that out. It should be similar to the App pages on the app stores but with the addition of technologies used and development notes.

**Thoughts** Excited to get this project up and running so I can show it to some people and get their responses.

<a name="day38"></a>
### Day 38: February 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was mainly spent trying to solve the timing problems I have that still appear sometimes when the page with the categories is first called. I have tried various combos of try & Catch and promises. I did however solve the problem with the Point system by moving the update over in to a new function so hopefully that will help with the others too. I also went through and Commented through more of my code so it is really well documented. Possible too much as I do think the code should be more self explanitary but then again if I look at the project in a couple of months I want to know what was going on. 

I also spent some time today working on the development page for this App as I will pressent it tomorrow to the class. It's still fairly rough but demonstrates enough what I need it to for the presentation tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I am getting a little to the point where I need a break from this project, the last three weeks have been intensly focused on it which has been great but I am also eager to take a step back and learn a little more that can then be applied to it.

### Day 39: February 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I presented the App, however it was not quite as planned. In the morning I tried to complete some more of the timing isssues I was having and of course it broke the App :( I was able to present the older version over Github pages (thank god Version control and Git) though this then did not include the Sever database as that is only available at localhost. A little disappointing but I think I got the main points about the App across.

**Thoughts** It was interesting to have the expereience of presenting the App especially in German. I will definitely need to work more on the App Development page to portray the App. I have also noticed the App shows essentially only a loading bar on IPhones which is a disadvantage when it is supposed to be a protfolio piece. This is mainly due to the PWA technology being a google thing, so I would have to give that up to get it working on Iphone but perhaps I can run a stripped version that works better across the different browsers and devices.

### Day 40: February 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the errors from yesterday in my Vocab App and tidied everything up, I need to step away from this project before completing it. But it'S very near to being finished, just polishing up needs to be done and checking what I can do for supporting Iphones and other Browsers performance. In the Evening I continued with the Calculus course from MIT.

**Thoughts** I hope the Vocab App will serve me well as a portfolio piece as I put a lot of work in there, but there is still 4% of finishing work will have to do. First I'd like to take a break and learn some more before taking a look with fresh eyes. The App is running on the link below.

### Day 43: February 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Fresh Week and I am now starting the module on PHP and MySQL. I started with another course from Udemy by Brad Hussey, as I had already learnt the majority of the basics I jumped to his final tutorial on building a dynamic website with PHP. I should finish this tomorrow and be able to apply what I learnt to my Book Club App.

**Thoughts**

### Day 44: February 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Udemy course and went through some PHP documentation at php.net I then took my Book Club App and pulled it apart so I could redesign it with what I have learnt. I spent a while also on the redesign, this app will be much more Web based but should also be responsive so I need to make sure it is mobile first particulary with it's navigation.

**Thoughts** Re-energized to be starting a new project, I've already got a good starting structure so now it'S down to the nitty gritty.

### Day 45: February 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked through the book Einstieg in PHP7 and My SQL by Thomas Theis, chapter 1 up to 2.3. Also added a form to my Book Club web app and styled it, got as far as the MySQL query.
In the evening I started week 10 of Machine Learning by Coursera - only one more week to go with that course! I have signed up to Kaggle to start doing Machine Learning examples.

**Thoughts** Had a few ideas for smaller front end projects to build on code pen to showcase my programming skills. Particulary I would like to focus on UX and input interactions. One would be to change the font based on the speed of typing or break up how we type, eventually it would be cool to have hardware to make the type more dynamic as when we talk but I thought of a couple ideas with italics and Bold to play with.

### Day 46: February 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Book Club App, moved a few things around and made the book list searchable. In the evening I worked on a codepen CSS drawing of myself, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I tweeted a picture of it and got a response from Lynn Fisher! (asinglediv.com) which was super encouraging and all round awesome. 

**Thoughts** It as nice to take time and do something a little different and a bit more creative.

### Day 47: February 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Book Club App, mainly friday clean up of code and projects. Continued on with the PHP Book also. In the evening I skyped with Arati who will hopefully be my partner when applying for the Rails Girls Summer of Code, she seems like a great fit as we are both on a similar level and she has great energy. We will meet again Monday to discuss everything futher and which project we will apply too.

**Thoughts** Now I have a possible partner the RSoC is looking much more possible and I am excited at the prospect of it actually maybe happening!

### Day 48: February 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Machine Learning for this week. In the later half of the day I started a new CSS drawing, this time of the hostest with the mostest Rupaul! <3 you can view it at the link below -super enjoying this creative outlet.

**Thoughts** The CSS drawing is super fun as a side project. I am determined to move into ML and AI though so I need to keep focused. I have started reading Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/ it's a really interesting look at the ethical complications of Algorithms used within our banking systems and beyond. I also really like this talk by Kate Crawford https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=fMym_BKWQzk about the trouble with Bias when we apply these Algorithms to the real world.

We put together out game plan for approaching coaching companies and which projects we would like to apply to. We also have pretty much decided on the name Two Bits ^^ *Fingers crosses* we get in!!

**Thoughts** Really excited at the prospect of getting into the Scholarship and working with Arati on an open source project its exactly the kind of "real world" experience I need now so super hope we get in.

### Day 51: February 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a lot of time sorting out my gitHub repositories in preparation for presenting it as part of the application for RSoC. In the evening I attended the PyLadies meetup. We went through Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy also using Matplotlib and datetime. It put in to perspective a lot of what I learnt through the codeacademy Beta Data Science track, which was perfect after this busy week is over I am planning to pull our more Kaggle data sets to explore with in this way.

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed the meet up again, it was also lovely to see Katy at Native Instruments. I approached the Pyladies Team and offered my time to help them as they are looking for someone to help out with Social media. The response seemed positive so we will see!

### Day 52: February 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I reached out to Camila Ayres who works at Nextcloud, she had put herself forwards internally as a possible mentor for RGSoC. As the only female on the list I really wanted to reach out to her. Markus, my friend who coach us, will be a great mentor but I would also like a female mentor. She got back to us almost straight away inviting us to join the Nextcloud meetup that evening. It was a bit of a quick turn around as I was meeting Arati straight from the gym and ran home inbetween our meeting and the Meetup to drop my gym bag and change! The Meetup was amazing, we got stuck straight in and going about installing a VM on our machines so we could run the Nextcloud development enviroment. There were a few other members there as well as Camila. John who works at Oracle and gave me loads of tips about how to navigate through the Command Line. Jokab who also helped us get everything installed. Jos, Camilas partner who also works at Nextcloud and their adorable puppy Popcorn. We were their quite late and it was fairly intense but exciting. Camila is keen to coach us which is amazing!

**Thoughts** The process of applying for the RGSoC is quite intense but with a second coach and now pretty sure Nextcloud will be the project we apply to I amd feeling more positive about it happening.

### Day 53: February 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  After the last PyLadies Meetup I decided to put myself forwards to help with the Organisation. the recpetion was pretty positive and I am now running their Twitter feed. It had been a little neglected so just adding activity has been a good start. I am trying to make sure the posts and retweets touch a range of topics and stay quite politically neutral, although obviously I am using alot of diversity tags. I am also contacting my partners work to ask them about hosting our May event. Hopefully I am able to pull this off. Outside of the Twitter account I am hoping I can also add a little more activity on the slack channel.

**Thoughts** I am pretty excited to be involved with the PyLadies group I have super enjoyed the last 5 Meetups and keen to give what I can to the community. It will also help me Network, though I feel pretty intimated by all the amazing women already working in tech. I think this will force me not to be shy and have a reason to speak more of the women.

### Day 54: February 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today we met with Camila at her place to continue on pur Nextcloud work. The session was a little frustrating as we hit quite a lot of bumps but Camila was super supportive and very dedicated. I had to cut off the session as I have a 2 day workshop this weekend and I felt we otherwise would be there all night! In the end we kind of had things running more than before but no where near the point where we could really work efficiently on the first issue. We have set another meeting for Monday so hopefully we have more success then.

**Thoughts** It was really super to work with Arati and Camila and work through our problems together, even after a long day. It was perhaps a insight into what we may be doing in the summer, fingers crossed!

### Day 55: February 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was day one of Women Who Go - Ultimate Go Workshop. The workshop today was super intense but really interesting, we learnt alot! Bill Kenedy the teacher speaks at an incrediable pace but he does repeat points alot which helps them sink in. We spent all the time looking through code and talking about best practices and atually did no coding in GO. The approach was great because it gave more of an overviewing theory than a language specific introduction. Learning about the connection between the code you write and the hardware was super fascinating and definitely something I want to know more about. I am very keen to connect this to the other languages I have learnt. 

**Thoughts** The workshop was also a great opportunity to meet with other women developers and hear their experience. This was at times also a little intimidating and I am feeling a little imposter sysdrome although everyone was very friendly. Pretty tired by the end of the day but looking forwards to tomorrow.

### Day 56: February 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day two of Ultimate Go Workshop was equally as intense but just as enjoyable. Again it was predominently therory and non language specific but at least I now have an idea of how Golang looks and works. I also had the chance to talk with Mei Li organiser of PyLadies Berlin about how I can help there, which was reaffirming. In the evening I completed the videos for the final week of Machine Learning with Andrew Ng from Coursera. I have now completed this course.

**Thoughts** The weekend was pretty intense but I learnt alot. I also had a really nice chat with Ronna from Women who Go and she was very encouraging I have therefore signed up to the next WWG workshop this coming Wednesday, I am also interested after all this theory to code something in Go.

### Day 57: February 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today we met to continue working on our first Nextcloud issue. We both have our development enviroments better set up and were able to get started on the issue, the first part: the JavaScript was fairly straight forwards but when we got to the CSS we hit a problem. It seemed like our CSS was not being take over when the code was compiled although we saw it in the style sheets. Camila tried a few things with us including cleaning the cache of the MAKE environment but no luck. In the end we had to move on and organise our application. We recieved news that Absolventa are interested in being our coaching company, as Markus had asked on our behalf. Everything is coming together which is exciting and also a little nerve wrecking incase we don't get in, we now have a large group of people supporting us.

**Thoughts** It has definitely been a little frustrating that we have not been able to properly work on an issue due to set up problems, but that is defiitely a part of the process. It's been really encouraging to have the support of so many industry professionals and exciting how the group has come together. Now just to finish the application and send it off.

### Day 58: February 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: This evening I met another of our Mentors for RGSoC, Lora, she is a friend of Arati and until now we had not had chance to meet. However she was given a talk on containers orchastration by Kubernetes this evening for Women Tech makers which I had alrady signed up to so it seemed to be perfect situation. The talk was a great over view of Kubernetes and how it fits into the picture with containers. This is definitely something I would like to know more about as containers seem to be very popular. Lora was a little ill so I only got a chance to briefly introduce myself, however hopefully through the RGSoC programme we will get to hang our more. 

**Thoughts** Another interesting meetup from WTM, I should have taken the time to introduce myself to Natalie who runs it, she seems to be a pretty inspirational organisor for Women in Tech groups. I did talk to the PyData team who presented at the start, I am helping organise a brainstorming session for this with PyLadies and I asked them about volunteering at the event.

### Day 59: February 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: We pressed the button and sent our Application off today for RGSoC! Woohoo so fingers crossed we get in we won't find out until mid April. We also Skyped with Kaja and the Absolventa Team as they have offered to be a coaching company. She seems really nice and also a hard worker which is good inspiration. Kaja actually was a Rails girl last year at Absolventa and got offered a Job at the end of the scholarship so is something of a success story.

In the evening Arati and I went to the Women Who Go workshop to make a Gopher Chess it was really fun and I worked with a girl to work through the code. This pai programming was a lovely experience, although I had to follow her lead as I don't know the language at all I was able to understand the logic and got familar with the syntax pretty quickly.

**Thoughts** Excited and a little relieved now the application is in, it was a lot of work and a few things fell on the same week which made it quite a straineous week. I am planning to attend more WWG meetups though I think I need to focus on Python now as I believe that is the language I would like to find work in.

### Day 60: March 01, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I recieved my MicroPyBoard for the PyLadies IOT workshop on the the 17th. I much looking forwards to this workshop and excited to start experiementing with the board. Of course no time like the presence so I set the board up and started running through the tutorial on the MicroPyBoard website. I managed to get the LEDs lighting up, two also have intensity settings. One tutorial also demonstrated the accelerometer and had you build a level which was interesting to see the sesitivity of the sensor. I also put the board into mouse mode so it could be used as a mouse.

**Thoughts** Very excited for the workshop and to be able to get a better grasp on hardware programming!

### Day 61: March 02, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I edited and polised an article I have been writing on why I think the Rails Girls Summer of Code has an important impact on diversity in the Tech industry and should be supported by more companies. I wrote this after we talked with Jos about not so many Teams being sponsored and how we could maybe raise awareness. I published the article to Medium (Link is below) and tweeted it managing to get several retweets. It was good process to write a slightly longer piece as I would definitelybe interested in blogging my experience and writing technical articles in the future. It was also very theraputic putting my thoughts down on paper (so to speak because I typed it of course ^^)

**Thoughts** It was a lot of work making sure this piece expressed my feelings but was clear and concise in its message. A very valuable learning expereience which I plan to repeat and hope can also bring some awareness to the Summer of Code. Of course the more Teams sponsored the greater chance Arati and I have of getting in so it is also in my interest, however thats not my main motivation.

### Day 62: March 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  I started to go through the Golang Course on Udemy today, mainky looking at the format and what was covered, it seems new content for routines has been adding which is great that it is so up to date. I am not sure when I will have time to properly start this course as the next the few weeks are going to be busy. However I hope to be able to do some before the next Women Who Go workshop in April so that I have a better grasp of the language. 

**Thoughts** Although I am a little unsure about starting another langauge I am interested to see what Golang can do particular because although it is a higher level language you can still feel a real effect on the processor and hardware. I plan to keep this to a minimum of the attending the WWG workshops and completing this course, however I wouldn't be adverse to a project in the language and I have also seen it is suitable for IoT and even machine learning.

### Day 63: March 04, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today we were finally able to make our first PR for Nextcloud! We met at Home cafe and finished off our solution before making the request, which was super exciting! This was particulary satifying considering the amount of time we needed setting up our enviroment and working out problems. We quickly got a review that suggested an extra step to improve our solution although we were still able to merge our progress so far as the extension can be completed afterwards. It was good going through the process of making a pull request with Camila, though I feel I will have to do it a few more times before I feel confident with it. Throughout this process we have changed around our work flow quite a few times, which has ultimately made it better, however it has left me slightly confused to what the exact steps were. I am hoping with repetition this will become more clear.

**Thoughts** It was great to make our first pull request as I feel we were both feeling a little over whelmed and disappointed everything was taking so long. So now finally something to celebrate, though we are already planning what we will tackle next!

**Today's Progress**: Today is Internation Women's Day so after school I went to the Berlin Womens March. My friend Matze who is a programmer joined me and we had a great time marching together. Some of his friends joined including Franziska who works at WikiMedia and has been very vocal in Germany about internet freedom. We went for some drinks afterwards and Matze explained me that maybe she can help host PyLadies at her work and also give a talk.

**Thoughts** Very happy and proud to march with my sisters and celebrate women everywhere!

### Day 70: March 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  This last week alongside coding I have been reading Weapons of Math destruction by Cathy O'Neil. She explains very thorough examples of how algorithms used in society can be heavily based and have devastating outcomes for those it targets. I highly reccomend the book as it was a fascinating read and very well put together as well as being very informative. I also watched recently a talk by Kate Crawford on a similar field which I also really enjoyed. I will post the link below.

**Thoughts** Another reason for being drawn to work within tech and with machine learning is the effect it has on the society around us, both positive and negative. Its a discussion I would like to be a part of and know more about.

### Day 71: March 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Today I continued with Automate the Boring things with Python by Al schweirgert. This chapter was about file manipulation and in particular PDF. As I have just learnt something similar in PHP I found this good timing and pretty interesting, although at least for the libraries demonstrated it seems PHP allows for more maipulation when creating PDF files than Python.

**Thoughts** This course is extremely good, Al has a very nice manner of explaining the tasks keeping them interesting while still thorough. I have also looked at some of his other resources for after this course is completed.

### Day 72: March 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Today was the first Meetup for PyLadies I have organised, to say I was nervous is an understatement. I had maanged to get a space at Trifork thanks to my contact there Dajana (I met her when we made coffee for the Eurocamp Conf, a Ruby conference. We were just the right amount of attendees and I think everyone got something from it. Personally I really enjoyed listening to all the Women's ideas for talks, though I also felt quite intimidated. A certain amount of feeling overwhelmed and non belonging I assume is normal but still kind of stressed me out, though everyone in the group is lovely and super encouraging. I hope we will see some interesting talks come out of the session and be presented at PyData in July which I have volunteered to help at. 

**Thoughts** Feeling a little bit of imposter syndrome and intimidation but keen to keep going and push through. It was great to hang out with such interesting women working in the fields of engineering, data science and education.

### Day 73: March 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Today I finished the Automate the Boring things with Python course on Udemy, I super enjoyed this course and are keen to continue my Python learning. The last chapter was about controlling the Mouse and Keyboard and also Image Recognition which I found interesting. Python has the built in capacity to find an image on a screen as long as it is pixel perfect to the one you gave it. Al the tutor also show a programme he had written to play 'Sushi Go Round' game, I found this great being able to see an application of  what we had learnt.

**Thoughts** I can really reccomend this course, Al is well humoured and well paced tutor who gives plenty of detail while still making it accessible. I am looking forwards to moving forwards with my Python knowledge.

### Day 74: March 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:   Today I started the Udemy 30 Days of Python course, I skipped over a few of the basic classes and went on to the sending emails module. This was a nice continuation of what I learnt from the Automate the Boring things course with some additional functionality and another way of writing out the code. It also went through building a group emailing service from an initial class from an early class that I went back and watched through.

**Thoughts** It was really great applying what I have learnt so far and learning how to build it into modules which is not used as much in JavaScript. It feels good to be getting more familiar with Python Syntax.

### Day 75: March 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Today I decided to continue with the 30 days of Python. The subject was editing and writing CSV files which is helpful for Data Base manipulation. I the evening I checked my MicoPython PyBoard again to make sure it is ok for the workshop tomorrow! :D

**Thoughts** I enjoyed working with Python this week alot and seeing where it differs and where it has similarities. I would like to spend more time here so I can make myself even more familar with the syntax but also think it's important to learn the Data base design while I have my last few weeks at Indisoft and finish off the projects I have made here.

### Day 76: March 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was the PyLadies IoT workshop, I have been super looking forwards to it and I was not disappointed. Christine from MicroPython did a great job explaining the company behind the Microcontrollers and how to start using them. We then had a presentation from Amazon and how they are using IoT in their company. The rest of the day was spent trying to get programmes running on our PyBoards such as lighting up LEDs, running servo motors and getting Humidty and Temperature read outs. I met loads of interesting people including Zissi who works at Infarm who specialise in Aquaponics Argiculture, something that really interests me and hopefully I will go over there and see their set up. Actually as a project I want to build a small grow house measuring and logging temperature and humidity, perhaps also light and soil moisture levels. The next step would be to add controllers that can then based on the data alter the enviroment.

**Thoughts** I really enjoyed today and are very keen to continue with this path of programming for hardware. I also think as the market is increasing there will be plenty of opportunities in this field which is super exciting! I am now planning more projects with the devices I have.

### Day 77: March 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with my PyBoard to complete the read outs from the Humidity and Temperature being displayed on the LCD screen. I also tried to get it to update when the USR switch is pressed but it was displaying a memorary error so I need to figure out what causes this, but I believe it is connected to the interupts caused by the callback function. I also would like to see if I can change the display when the temperature or humidity changes by a certain amount. 

**Thoughts** Again I am really digging working with the hardware and programming, I definitely want to dig into this more. From the workshop I was able to see how to put the code into small functions and run scripts through the main.py this links into what I have been learning about python so I keen to dig in more to both learning it straight and applying that to the IoT devices.

### Day 79: March 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: A little back to normality today, I spent the day working on a the HTML and JS for my PDF CV Builder, the programme will take form details and turn it into a PDF CV using PHP and then email it to the user. Currently this would be without a Data Bank but that could be a later addition. In the evening after going to the gym and doing the shopping I looked at my PyBoard again but hit more problems than solutions :) still fun!

We are planning to attend the Hackweek from Nextcloud in April and I have been trying to organise accomedation for us. Unfortunately one of the girls from Albania that we are hoping to share with can no longer come, though I have reserved an apartment for us for 5 so we need to try find another person to share with as apartments for four are almost as expensive!!

**Thoughts** Still feel like there's not enough hours in the day but very happy that I get to code everyday and sitting in the Sauna at the gym is a very good "chill" out!

### Day 86: March 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on from learning about Databases I focused today on the Maths behind the queries. The Standford couse has a section on pure relational Algebra which was led by a mathematician. This felt like a very thorough approach to understanding the underpinning theories and equations behind databases which I am happy to invest in so I have a good understanding of the architecture. Additionally learning the equations has helped me understand better the SQL queries I have learnt so far.


**Thoughts** It was very enjoying to learn some Maths, I am looking to schedule time to continue also with the MIT linear algebra course when I return from Stuttgart in two weeks.

<a name="day87"></a>
### Day 87: March 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I continued on with Relational Algebra toaday and completed the exercises for the Standford class. These were very challenging but a lot of fun! They slowly got harder but I managed to pass them all. However I did realise afterwards when reviewing my answer that although it had passed the tests and did suply the correct answer, I had hard coding in information from the data and it was therefore specific to the question and not general. I would like to look futher to see if I can figure out the correct answer and I have also printed out additional questions to test myself.


**Thoughts** It's been really great getting stuck into the maths behind this and putting it together to see the relation to code and SQl queries. The course with Standford although very technical was thorough and I will look into more of their Maths classes for other subjects.

### Day 88: March 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: After the IoT workshop with PyLadies I had written a blog post about what we did and with who. This was stipulated by the sponsors but also good for us to keep a record and something as a collective we would like to do more often. Today I styled the Bootstrap template that Mei Li had added to the github pages for the workshop. This was mainly adjusting some styling and adding images and links, so not too difficult. The main challenge was pushing it to their Github account as I am still a little unsure about the organisations works and permission, however in the end once I had the rights to add to the repo I was able to push it and make it go live!


**Thoughts** It was really nice working on a real project, though also a little nerve wracking as I was worried I would mess it up. Alot learnt in the process which is super valuable. I am looking to redo their website using Django once I have finished with the school.

### Day 89: March 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked at my friends cafe for the Easter break, a nice chance to do something different and earn a bit of cash. However I continued with the 30 Days of Python course a little in the evening, mainly consolidating what I have learnt so far. I also discovered the PyBites Podcast and listened to a couple of episodes.


**Thoughts** I am keen to keep up the progress with my Python programming and already found a few courses I am interested to do when I finish the 30 Days course. I think I should also move on to projects hich allow me to expand my skills and offer a chance to produce portfolio pieces.

### Day 90: March 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I went to EnthusiastiCon, a conference for mainly new speakers to talk about their knowledge or projects. My main reason for going wa that one of the PyLadies members Ellen was giving a talk on Machine Learning which I was keen to see. However there were a number of interesting projects shown including an LED dress that using a Adafruit unit changed color and how lit up it was according to the change in volume of  the sound around it. It looked a little like an old stereo display but of course much prettier! There was also a talk about Python programming in the console which I enjoyed and one about self care and avoiding burn out. Overall it was very enjoyable and Mei Li also joined so it was lovely chatting with her and Jose. He had been a systems adminstrator back in spain for linux setting them up for schools and had also studied a bit of electrical engineering, though had left before the course ending.


**Thoughts** It was nice to see some first time speakers and hear about a few interesting projects though not all I was able to follow or found super interesting, over all the conference was nice. I chilled the rest of the day as I am working in the cafe the next two days.

### Day 91: Aril 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I was working again at the cafe so only got a little bit of 30 Days of Python done. This time Web Scraping from sites using JS, so to be able to fetch data after it is loaded using Selenium as a web driver. I can definitely see me using Web scraping in the future so its been good to go through it and see how relatively easy it is. I didn't quite get through this chapter but plan to finish it tomorrow.


**Thoughts** I am really enjoying expanding my Python knowledge and seeing what is capable with it. I am also hopeing by running through these projects I can get an idea how to lay my own code out for my own projects.

### Day 93: April 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the styling for the CV PDF Bulder App, so now it looks fancy :) This was quite a quick process as I could reuse styles I had developed for my other projects and it really brings the project to a more polished stand point. Although there is a lot more work I can do on it, I feel it portrays the initial idea I wanted to experiment with. I aim to use this as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my PHP knowledge and how I approach a project. Something I wish I had done is noted the time I took for the projects more so I could give them more scope. I think this would be useful as I am not intending to complete the project and would rather have it displayed as a demo or short project.


**Thoughts** I am quite happy with this piece as a short project to demonstrate my PHP knowledge and one aspect of what the language is capable of. With the styling it looks alot better already so I am only going to do finishing touches on this.

### Day 94: April 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: My focus today was completing the database queries for the Book Club App. Having set the database up correctly with the intersecting tables I just need to make sure these were updated when a user selected a book in the poll or answered regarding about their attendance. I would still like to continue working on the construction of the JS for this project as I had started completely reworking it but I will do that once I am back after Hackweek and worked out my schedule. I also completed a few bits on the PDF builder so I can present it tomorrow to the others on the course. I adding a loading function for when the PDF is being made and the email part with PHP mailer although it was not working on my locale host in Indisoft I got it working at home.


**Thoughts** Looking forwards to my last day tomorrow and presenting the project. I have at least 3 solid pieces that are not completed projects but very fleshed out. Also importantly they are are all on github and have daily pushes to them to show my work commitment and activity.

### Day 95: April 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today was my last day at Indisoft as I will miss the last two official days because of the Hackweek and tomorrow I am taking holiday as I fly to the UK. I definitely have mixed feelings about the experience of this course. Structure and feedback were lacking which made it at times quite frustrating on the other hand we had the opportunity to work freely on our own projects which for myself was great as I had a clear idea of how I wanted to proceed and definietly would have been more frustrated if we had been forced to work through their text books or attend back to back lectures from the teachers, already the lectures we had (two a week) were lacking in substance and felt more like the teacher trying to pass the time (* In fairness not all were like this, however it was the vast majority.) I am still glad I completed the course and the eventual feedback I got was very positive and encouraging although I will most likely not go in the direction it bought me the time to learn some underlying themes and afford the time to continue learning without having to work part time.


**Thoughts** I am very excited to be moving on from this course and starting the next chapter of my developer journey, already I have lots planned and I am looking forwards to being able to set my own schedule!

### Day 96: April 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I flew to the UK as my Uncle has his 60th birthday and I will stay the first night with my Brother and his wife. I prepped by downloading a few different podcasts I had found including Machine Learning Guide and the AI Podcast. The first is a structure series that you can use a curiculum with a large selection of additional resources to supplement your learning. Already I am pretty excited to encoperate this in my next round of 100 Days of Code. I listened to the first 4 podcasts and started one of the recommended books. I intend to do this again more focused after I return from Stuttgart, however I didn't want to slack on my last days of this round.


**Thoughts** Looking forwards to catching up with my family and having a bit of a break to celebrate finishing the course at Indisoft and round one of my 100 Days of Code.

### Day 99: April 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today Arati, my partner for the RGSoC, travelled to Stuttgart on train for the Nextcloud Hackweek. The train journey was a great chance to catch up with other and talk about our plan for the week. She also had some exciting news to share with me for her own development. We are both excited to be taking part in the Hackweek all be it a little nervous and unsure of what to expect. After arriving and checking into our hostel and meeting Xheni from Albanian who is also doing the Hackweek and is staying with us we went for a wander into the city center. It is pretty similar to other southern german towns I have visited but none the less has a little of it's own feel. We then went to meet the Nextclouders for dinner, after a bit of  mix up about location we had Tacos, and Burgers with Jos and Camila, we also got to meet the others though they ate before we arrived due to our location faux par. Perhaps not surprising is that Camila is the only women, I am so glad we have her as a coach she is a great inspiration. However the guys were all pretty friendly though we both definitely felt a little like fresh exhibits. We got a quick tour of some of the city sights from Jan who we met at the last meetup and then went to see the office space. We headed home at ten though the others still seemed in full swing because we were all a little tired from travelling, and had to figure our way back to the hostel :) I had some upsetting personal news today but both Xheni and Arati were really supportive which makes me feel very positive about staying the week here.


**Thoughts** I can't believe it's day 99!! And for day 100 I'll be participate in a Hackweek for an open source project, it still feels a little unreal if I'm honest but very exciting at the same time.

### Day 100: April 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Day 100 - I made it!! Hard to believe the 100 Days has finished already. However I have definitely achieved alot in this time. Looking back over my progress has been extremely satisfying though there is still plenty I have lined up to do. I am extremely happy to be able to finish this round at a Hackweek for an open source project with my RGSoC partner and new friend Arati as well as another new friend Xheni (alumni RGSoC). It is super encouraging to see their success and skills. Of course it is also great the support we are also getting from others at the Hackweeksuch as Daniel, Jan and of course Jos and Camila. Working on a real project is incredibly rewarding. Today we worked on an extension of our first pull request to show the actual count with a hover over if it is more than 9999 as this displays as 9999+ We learnt alot on the way to achieving this, as we have with all our other work on this project.


**Thoughts** I'm super happy to have finished round one but also already planning round 2! I am incredibly gratefull to all my family and friends who have been extremely supportive and kept me going. I plan to write a longer blog post on my over all experience and the Hackweek which I will link below.
