# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech,Â ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on putting a few of my code trials on Codepen. The one below I developed from Wes Bros' 30daysofJavaScript. It was a really valuable course and I learnt so much from it. This pen combines a few of the classes in one as well as being based on a programme (pizza order) that I built at the start of my JavaScript course at Indisoft.

**Thoughts**: Alongside the above I also continued with the Machine Learning course and at the day course learn the basics of PHP. I am really enjoying coding so much but finding the hour for 100DaysofCode for me is most useful for keeping on top of Documentation and keeping my projects in check - super valuable!

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
