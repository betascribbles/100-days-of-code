### Day 1: January 1, 2018 <a name="day1"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech, ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 <a name="day2"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Worked on putting a few of my code trials on Codepen. The one below I developed from Wes Bros' 30daysofJavaScript. It was a really valuable course and I learnt so much from it. This pen combines a few of the classes in one as well as being based on a programme (pizza order) that I built at the start of my JavaScript course at Indisoft.

**Thoughts**: Alongside the above I also continued with the Machine Learning course and at the day course learn the basics of PHP. I am really enjoying coding so much but finding the hour for 100DaysofCode for me is most useful for keeping on top of Documentation and keeping my projects in check - super valuable!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 <a name="day3"></a>

**Today's Progress**: At my daytime class I did alot of PHP on Udemy which felt good but shot my mind alittle. This afternoon I completed Machine Learning week 4 and started the codeacademy Data Science track. I also did a couple of Code war Kata today and a little freecode camp as mental breaks from the PHP.

**Thoughts** Intense day on PHP but very happy with the process! Also have split out a couple of features from my vocab trainer onto codepen so I can edit these features.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018 <a name="day4"></a>

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the PHP & SQL part of the course I was following and starting an example for a Book Club app I spent the afternoon adapting the Pong game I made last year into a Birthday gift for a friend. Link below. Working with the audio inside the loops was quite tricky and it is a little buggy but hopefully he likes it. As we're out to Dinner tonight and I have an appointment this afternoon I doubt I will get much more done but hope to do a little more code academy Data Science.

**Thoughts** Ok kind of slacked off working on this game for my friend but it was a little tricky in part and good to revisit old code to see how far I have come. I plan to move a few of my private Bitbucket Repos over to Github this weekend so I have more to show there.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 <a name="day5"></a>

**Today's Progress**:Today I put that PHP knowledge to practice, after transfering data from my JSON file to my database (see previous post) I started to manipulate the page and get some simple design elements in. St

Not feeling overly well so had a mid afternoon nap and read a little of Interactive Data Visualisation This evening I have been continuing through the code academy Data Science Beta track learning Matplotlib for python. 

**Thoughts** Pretty excited for the potential of the PHP I have learnt and being able to apply it to both the Book Club App I have started and my on going Vocab Trainer. I am debating trying to make the Book Club app using React also to demonstrate and practice those skills, I believe it will be a good (tough) challenge and give me a chance to showcase library use) Though I intend to keep the Vocab Trainer Vanilla JS.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 <a name="day6"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most the afternoon trying to get Anaconda with python 3 and Jupyter Notebook running properly on my machine. At the last Meetup I went to I had a bit of a personal crisis as I had last minute updated or installed something which stopped me from being able to open Jupyter Notebook and therefore participate in the code along lecture on Unsupervised learning. However once I got this up and running I could put into practice the MatPlotLib classes from Codeacademy and draw some charts :)

**Thoughts** Feeling happy now after fixing this, but frustrated most of the afternoon, however the work has paid off. Now I'm going for a much earnt bath with my book!!

### Day 7: January 7, 2018 <a name="day7"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I had a bit of a day off and took some time for chores and reading the Book for my Book Club. I did however complete the next section on the Codeacademy Data Science Track. 

**Thoughts** Week one complete! Feeling like I accomplished alot and looking forwards to the next 93 days :)

### Day 8: January 8, 2018 <a name="day8"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent pretty much all day split between setting up my PHP and working with React. I'm pretty keen to incorporate the JS library in my Book Club app as it will show use of a library in my portfolio and is used for a lot of web apps UI. I have been following along a Udacity course on Progressive Web Apps and try to model my App of that also as I find coding along and then applying it to my own work a good set up personally. Lots of time on Stack overflow today...thank goodness for that website! Yet to need to post as I mostly have found answers but I am having a problem with my AJAX requests so after another look at it tomorrow I may have to hit the forums!

**Thoughts** It was an intense day of mainly going back and forth and not a huge sense of achievement at the end of it, though I am sure it will be worth it in the end! Otherwise I have put a few of my repositories on Github now so they are public apose to the ones I currently have on Bitbucket. Tomorrow I am going to Tech Women Meetup which I am looking forwards to and hope to be a bit futher with my Apps!

### Day 9: January 9, 2018 <a name="day9"></a>

**Today's Progress**: I signed up to Codewars about a month ago but from today I am commiting to doing one Kata per day in JS. Honestly the benefit of taking time out from tutorial and apps I’m building to work on a small(ish) coding challenge is huge! T

Now I am off the Women Tech Makers Berlin Meetup at Native Instruments where they are having a group of talks about working in development for music apps, not per say my field but hopefully a chance to meet some new faces.

Until tomrorow!

**Thoughts** The Meetup was great 3 staff members from Native Instruments discussed their roles in the company and what their looked to achieve within their department but also as a company and product. They were pretty candid about how the Berlin office is not very diverse but talked about how they hoped to improve it. Katy Peichart the head of Recruitment talked about how she believes when your recruiting if you don't have a diverse candiancy pool then you should look to fix that not shrug it of. I couldnt agree more and I find it super refreshing to find a recruiter with this atitude.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018 <a name="day10"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App wired up with PHP finally! Woohoo! worked a little on the design also, I want to have the cards where you train similar to children langauge learning cards. I also styled Book Club app and got more under the hood with React - still alot to learn there. I am concerned how I will fix this up with PHP and also if that's the right route but not sure it is smart to take on another techknology right now. Lastly or rather firstly as I did this first thing this morning I completed a Kata and wrote a blog post about my approach( link below). I found the process really rewarding and it helped sink in the methods I used.

**Thoughts** 10% through and feeling reflective, it's been a great 10 days and I feel very positive about this experience and the energy I have at the moment. I just hope to keep the momentum. Talking last night with other developers ta the meetup was a chance to try out talking about my expereince and career goals. Still early days and need to be a little more focused but enjoying it immensly.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018 <a name="day11"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App using the service worker to store data in the local cach and work somewhat offline! Big step forwards but revealed a million bugs ^^ still happy with this progress I think roughing in these techknologies will save me from going back later an dhaving to make more changes. I also put this site up on Github Pages although cirrently it does not link up the PHP and is fairly buggy, still I am able to view it on my phone which is a great (though a little disappointing) insight into its performance. (Lots to work on :) )

**Thoughts** It was another day of going through documentation and various courses to piece together what I wanted but I was successful which was a nice feeling. I have also updated the look alittle of the Vocab Cards which has been satifying although a small win. The below helped alot today to get it clear in my head about service workers, I also looked at the Udacity courses but found they left too large of gaps for me but the code examples were good.

**Link(s) to work**:  Through github pages you can view my app here, thought it is currently very Buggy and not hooking up to the PHP it gives me a starting point for changing the layout and useability and actually access it on my phone.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018 <a name="day12"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on tidying up what I had been working on this week on both my apps. I did a couple of codewar Kata and a bit more of www.freecodecamp.org/ (I'm up to the Basic Algorithm Scripting). In the evening I had a friend over for dinner so I didn't get any additional coding done.

**Thoughts** Good end of week tie up and thinking about the next couple of weeks. I have three months left at Indisoft so I need to plan out how I am using this time. My goal is to get both apps up to a polished version in the first month and then focus on more PHP SQL learning with a view for data anaylsis and visualisation.



### Day 13: January 13, 2018 <a name="day13"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I got through Week 5 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera.org. It is focusing on Neural Network Learning and Backpropagation. I definitley find this course challenging, the concepts are absolutely fancinating but the Maths is alittle above (perhaps even alot although I don't feel totally lost) my level. However I am perservering because I am enjoying it and  I think it will give me some key concepts and algorithm but I will definietly need more study on this subject. I did however find these great videos for the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&app=desktop

**Thoughts** Definitely feeling a little like I am scraping by with the machine learning but I am enjoying it immensly and looking forwards to seeing where the course goes in terms of implementation examples.


### Day 14: January 14, 2018 <a name="day14"></a>

**Today's Progress**: This morning I focused on working through the week 5 programing challange from Machine Learning on coursera and then continued on through codeacademy data science Beta Track, almost done which I'm happy about, I then need to put in some time tomorrow checking my set up as Tuesday I have the Meetup on Tensor Flow.

**Thoughts** I took a bit of the weekend for reading and spending some time away from the computer which I think is important for balance and definitely feeling refreshed for the week ahead!

### Day 15: January 15, 2018 <a name="day15"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today during the day I focused on implementing my different lists (categories) in the Vocab App, I got this mostly completed today including have offline lists and locally stored ones. Tomorrow I need to work on being able to create new lists. Currently I am emulating the local ones so I can keep refreshing the code and cache. In the afternoon I focused on going through my Python notes and trying to complete the Tensorflow, unfortunately it has not been working and I will have to finish it tomorrow before the PyLadies Meetup.

**Thoughts** It was a progressive day for working on my App and I need to keep this flow up so I can finish it in the next four weeks :)



### Day 16: January 16, 2018 <a name="day16"></a>

**Today's Progress**: I managed to fix the fetch request bug this morning I needed to load my js within a then attached to the then that added the .html file into the html innertext. This way it was definitely loaded after the html is loaded! I also spent about 1.5 hours on a level 4 Kata but it was a bit too tricky for me, I will return to it. I dinished the lists implementation. This afternoon I completed installing the Tensorflow enviroment, it turned out Tensor flow does not work with Anaconda 32 bit and I had to uninstall everything and reinstall. I managed in the nick of time! The Meetup was great, Irina was a great instructor and incredibly patient to get everyone up and running. She gave a great introduction and insight to CNN as well as Tensorboard. I really enjoed this session and chatting with the other attendees.

**Thoughts** Really productive day but a long one, now very sleepy! zzzzzzz

### Day 17: January 17, 2018 <a name="day17"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent the afternoon refreshing my Python knowledge and getting my set up enviroment ready for use. I am planning to delve much more into using Python outside of Indisoft, prodominetly through Jupyter Notebooks but I also want to be more familiar with it in general. I am learning through PluralSight I have tried most learning resources online and found PluralSight the most comprehension, naturally some teachers are more engaging than others but overall their content is more thorough and indepth. With also intermediate and advanced courses I hope it will help me know level up from basics to professional.

**Thoughts** Happy to go back over these funamentals and refresh the language, very much needed and will help me move forward with the Data Science courses I have been taking.


### Day 18: January 18, 2018 <a name="day18"></a>

**Today's Progress**: VUE (Visual understanding Enviroment)  http://vue.tufts.edu  is a brilliant *free* software for mindmapping and diagraming workflows, functions anything you can think of. I used it today to replace original paper notes and concrete down how my App flows and how the UX is. I am also using it to explain my functions visually and things such as Scoring. 

I also started today to rough in the styling for when the keyboard is up when the user is inputing in a text field. Still alittle unsure of my soultion but this gives you an idea of what I am thinking. It essentially combines checking if an input is in focus, if yes it then checks if the VH has been reduced to less than 350, if this is the case it implements the .keyboardUp class to move unnesscary elements off screen.

This evening I continued on with Plural Sights Python Fundamentals, it's great! I also came across this Youtube Series for Machine Learning with Python which I plan to go through after I am further into the fundamentals.

**Thoughts** Honestly today I felt alittle blocked with my app on what to work on (although there is still a lot to go) instead of forcing it I decided to take a fresh approach with the mapping and diagrams which kept me thinking about the project and gave me some new ideas having looked at a different angles. I also went through the Freecodecamp JavaScript basic algorithms and a handful of Codewars Kata which I will blog about tomorrow.

### Day 19: January 19, 2018 <a name="day19"></a>

**Today's Progress**: After finishing mapping out all the scripts, functions and variables (blue are constants and green muttable variables) it is clear I need to organise the app much better and start refractoring this code into objects and modules. 

**Thoughts** In one way this is shocking how messy my code is, however on the other hand its been a great process and valuable to see the app spread out like this. I intend to then push these into class diagrams using draw.io.

### Day 20: January 20, 2018 <a name="day20"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I did the first half of this weeks Machine Learning course, the second half I will do tomorrow. Otherwise it's been anon code focused Day. I skyped with a friend in the states this morning about meeting in Canada later this year, had a consultation for a tattoo (my first) I will have on Tuesday, more on this to follow ^^ and met friends who have just returned from travelling in Australia. All round a super day but a little less coding than normal. Still at least 5 hours though, tomorrow I plan to put a little more time.

**Thoughts** The machine learning is so fascinating but definitely needs a lot of concentration and therefore a little draining in big chunks but by splitting it up and digesting it more slowly I am finding it is going in better :) I also spoke with my Grandparents ( who I will visit in Canada) as it was my Grandads 89th birthday!

### Day 20: January 21, 2018 <a name="day21"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Today I finshed this weeks Machine Learning course. (week 6) It was great to be able to implement some of the previous learnt knowledge to complete the programing challenge. Unfortunately in the afternoon my computer crashed and will not reboot. Luckily after I had completed all the Machine Learning but still concerning as my Data is on there and I had unfortuately not backed it up yet :( Hopefully can get it working again tomorrow.

**Thoughts** The Machine Learning course is really challenging me but I am super enjoying it! I definitely will take more classes like this after completing this one, though I will finish this before making another commitment.


### Day 22: January 22, 2018 <a name="day22"></a>

**Today's Progress**: The computer is still broken :'( Total nightmare. At least during the day I am working on my Vocab App and also taking a little time for codewars.com Kata. You can see my progress on mapping out my functions below. I have almost converted all the different JS files into objects on the main.js file. I will complete this tomorrow.

**Thoughts** It looks like I will need to completely wipe and reinstall windows. I plan to buy a external hard drive to use in the future not just for Data back up but also to make a partition for running virtual enviroments.

### Day 23: January 23, 2018 <a name="day23"></a>

**Today's Progress**: So far completed the function to Objects conversion and started to fine tune some of the functions within those Objects. Also leveled up on codewars.com, I'm now a 5 kyū yellow belt Woop Woop! This afternoon I hope to get the computer up and running again and start the process of reinstalling everything!

**Thoughts** Not having a working computer at home is a total nightmare, I set up my Alexa last night as I would like to do the code academy course on programming it. Just need to get the computer working first.....

### Day 24 - 31: January 24 - 31, 2018 <a name="day24-31"></a>

**Today's Progress**:The end of January has been a bit of diaster because of my laptop and home machine breaking. I decided to spend all the time coding while at school and have therefore not updated this blog but rest assured plenty of coding every day. Meaning quite a lot of changes on my Vocab App! Below is the link to my journal where I have attached a few screen shots and explained how I have updated the design.

**Thoughts** Very bummed out not having a working computer. The new one I got last friday then had an error with one of the USB ports and has had to be returned, fingers crossed the next one comes before the weekend so I can start coding again!! Here's to a more successful February! <3

### Day 32: February 1, 2018 <a name="day32"></a>

**Today's Progress**: One design choice I made this week was that there will be no Desktop (Larger Screen) version of this App. Instead following the same URL the user will be taken to a page that displays how I made the app including a live version displayed in a iframe. At the moment this is achieved through an iframe which is only displayed if the screen is over 1050px (through a media query) however this is fairly laggy! So I will have to rethink this approach. It seems it somehow also messes with my Ajax calls though I am not completely sure what is bugging here, I will have to check. I have set this up through the gitHub pages so you can alreadys see it in action - though the development section is not progressed very far.


**Thoughts** The “Webpage” version of this Web App will provide information on what technologies are used, design examples, UX maps, sample code and of course a short explanation with user stories which I have aimed to meet. Honestly I think this is better than having a larger view of the App as I mainly plan to showcase this programme as a portfolio piece.

### Day 33: February 2, 2018 <a name="day33"></a>

**Today's Progress**: Fridays are my day for cleaning code, checking and adding comments. However today as I am getting to a first completion stage I have also got to the point to where the full implementation of the local storage needed to be completed. This turned out a little more complex than I had initiallly thought and changed up my idea of how I will collect the Data and when the user sends info to the database and when they get it. I actually think this process is super beneficial and will help me with my future Data Base projects. In the atfernoon I completed the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng Week 8 up until the programming challenge. My new laptop arrived and all seems to be working! Which is great so I am looking forwards to getting everything installed and up and running!

**Thoughts** Hoping the new set up will help me push forwards with my productivity, I am very keen to learn more Python and Data Science and put into practice what I have learnt so far int hese techknologies.
