# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech, ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on putting a few of my code trials on Codepen. The one below I developed from Wes Bros' 30daysofJavaScript. It was a really valuable course and I learnt so much from it. This pen combines a few of the classes in one as well as being based on a programme (pizza order) that I built at the start of my JavaScript course at Indisoft.

**Thoughts**: Alongside the above I also continued with the Machine Learning course and at the day course learn the basics of PHP. I am really enjoying coding so much but finding the hour for 100DaysofCode for me is most useful for keeping on top of Documentation and keeping my projects in check - super valuable!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: At my daytime class I did alot of PHP on Udemy which felt good but shot my mind alittle. This afternoon I completed Machine Learning week 4 and started the codeacademy Data Science track. I also did a couple of Code war Kata today and a little freecode camp as mental breaks from the PHP.

**Thoughts** Intense day on PHP but very happy with the process! Also have split out a couple of features from my vocab trainer onto codepen so I can edit these features.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the PHP & SQL part of the course I was following and starting an example for a Book Club app I spent the afternoon adapting the Pong game I made last year into a Birthday gift for a friend. Link below. Working with the audio inside the loops was quite tricky and it is a little buggy but hopefully he likes it. As we're out to Dinner tonight and I have an appointment this afternoon I doubt I will get much more done but hope to do a little more code academy Data Science.

**Thoughts** Ok kind of slacked off working on this game for my friend but it was a little tricky in part and good to revisit old code to see how far I have come. I plan to move a few of my private Bitbucket Repos over to Github this weekend so I have more to show there.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:Today I put that PHP knowledge to practice, after transfering data from my JSON file to my database (see previous post) I started to manipulate the page and get some simple design elements in. St

Not feeling overly well so had a mid afternoon nap and read a little of Interactive Data Visualisation This evening I have been continuing through the code academy Data Science Beta track learning Matplotlib for python. 

**Thoughts** Pretty excited for the potential of the PHP I have learnt and being able to apply it to both the Book Club App I have started and my on going Vocab Trainer. I am debating trying to make the Book Club app using React also to demonstrate and practice those skills, I believe it will be a good (tough) challenge and give me a chance to showcase library use) Though I intend to keep the Vocab Trainer Vanilla JS.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most the afternoon trying to get Anaconda with python 3 and Jupyter Notebook running properly on my machine. At the last Meetup I went to I had a bit of a personal crisis as I had last minute updated or installed something which stopped me from being able to open Jupyter Notebook and therefore participate in the code along lecture on Unsupervised learning. However once I got this up and running I could put into practice the MatPlotLib classes from Codeacademy and draw some charts :)

**Thoughts** Feeling happy now after fixing this, but frustrated most of the afternoon, however the work has paid off. Now I'm going for a much earnt bath with my book!!

### Day 7: January 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I had a bit of a day off and took some time for chores and reading the Book for my Book Club. I did however complete the next section on the Codeacademy Data Science Track. 

**Thoughts** Week one complete! Feeling like I accomplished alot and looking forwards to the next 93 days :)

### Day 8: January 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent pretty much all day split between setting up my PHP and working with React. I'm pretty keen to incorporate the JS library in my Book Club app as it will show use of a library in my portfolio and is used for a lot of web apps UI. I have been following along a Udacity course on Progressive Web Apps and try to model my App of that also as I find coding along and then applying it to my own work a good set up personally. Lots of time on Stack overflow today...thank goodness for that website! Yet to need to post as I mostly have found answers but I am having a problem with my AJAX requests so after another look at it tomorrow I may have to hit the forums!

**Thoughts** It was an intense day of mainly going back and forth and not a huge sense of achievement at the end of it, though I am sure it will be worth it in the end! Otherwise I have put a few of my repositories on Github now so they are public apose to the ones I currently have on Bitbucket. Tomorrow I am going to Tech Women Meetup which I am looking forwards to and hope to be a bit futher with my Apps!

### Day 9: January 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I signed up to Codewars about a month ago but from today I am commiting to doing one Kata per day in JS. Honestly the benefit of taking time out from tutorial and apps I’m building to work on a small(ish) coding challenge is huge! T

Now I am off the Women Tech Makers Berlin Meetup at Native Instruments where they are having a group of talks about working in development for music apps, not per say my field but hopefully a chance to meet some new faces.

Until tomrorow!

**Thoughts** The Meetup was great 3 staff members from Native Instruments discussed their roles in the company and what their looked to achieve within their department but also as a company and product. They were pretty candid about how the Berlin office is not very diverse but talked about how they hoped to improve it. Katy Peichart the head of Recruitment talked about how she believes when your recruiting if you don't have a diverse candiancy pool then you should look to fix that not shrug it of. I couldnt agree more and I find it super refreshing to find a recruiter with this atitude.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App wired up with PHP finally! Woohoo! worked a little on the design also, I want to have the cards where you train similar to children langauge learning cards. I also styled Book Club app and got more under the hood with React - still alot to learn there. I am concerned how I will fix this up with PHP and also if that's the right route but not sure it is smart to take on another techknology right now. Lastly or rather firstly as I did this first thing this morning I completed a Kata and wrote a blog post about my approach( link below). I found the process really rewarding and it helped sink in the methods I used.

**Thoughts** 10% through and feeling reflective, it's been a great 10 days and I feel very positive about this experience and the energy I have at the moment. I just hope to keep the momentum. Talking last night with other developers ta the meetup was a chance to try out talking about my expereince and career goals. Still early days and need to be a little more focused but enjoying it immensly.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got the Vocab App using the service worker to store data in the local cach and work somewhat offline! Big step forwards but revealed a million bugs ^^ still happy with this progress I think roughing in these techknologies will save me from going back later an dhaving to make more changes. I also put this site up on Github Pages although cirrently it does not link up the PHP and is fairly buggy, still I am able to view it on my phone which is a great (though a little disappointing) insight into its performance. (Lots to work on :) )

**Thoughts** It was another day of going through documentation and various courses to piece together what I wanted but I was successful which was a nice feeling. I have also updated the look alittle of the Vocab Cards which has been satifying although a small win. The below helped alot today to get it clear in my head about service workers, I also looked at the Udacity courses but found they left too large of gaps for me but the code examples were good.

**Link(s) to work**:  Through github pages you can view my app here, thought it is currently very Buggy and not hooking up to the PHP it gives me a starting point for changing the layout and useability and actually access it on my phone.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on tidying up what I had been working on this week on both my apps. I did a couple of codewar Kata and a bit more of www.freecodecamp.org/ (I'm up to the Basic Algorithm Scripting). In the evening I had a friend over for dinner so I didn't get any additional coding done.

**Thoughts** Good end of week tie up and thinking about the next couple of weeks. I have three months left at Indisoft so I need to plan out how I am using this time. My goal is to get both apps up to a polished version in the first month and then focus on more PHP SQL learning with a view for data anaylsis and visualisation.



### Day 13: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got through Week 5 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera.org. It is focusing on Neural Network Learning and Backpropagation. I definitley find this course challenging, the concepts are absolutely fancinating but the Maths is alittle above (perhaps even alot although I don't feel totally lost) my level. However I am perservering because I am enjoying it and  I think it will give me some key concepts and algorithm but I will definietly need more study on this subject. I did however find these great videos for the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&app=desktop

**Thoughts** Definitely feeling a little like I am scraping by with the machine learning but I am enjoying it immensly and looking forwards to seeing where the course goes in terms of implementation examples.


### Day 14: January 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: This morning I focused on working through the week 5 programing challange from Mahcine Learning on coursera and then continued on through codeacademy data science Beta Track, almost done which I'm happy about, I then need to put in some time tomorrow checking my set up as Tuesday I have the Meetup on Tensor Flow.

**Thoughts** I took a bit of the weekend for reading and spending some time away from the computer which I think is important for balance and definitely feeling refreshed for the week ahead!
