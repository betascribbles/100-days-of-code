# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech,Â ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
