# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked GitHub Repo. Documented starting the challenge on wordpress - see link below. Started Week 4 material for Andrew Ng@s Machine Learning on coursera and completed two Kata on codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Super excited to have this push to document more of my coding and being able to plot my progress over the next 100 days. My ultimate goal for 2018 is to get a job in Tech, ideally within or with a view to working in Data Visualisation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on putting a few of my code trials on Codepen. The one below I developed from Wes Bros' 30daysofJavaScript. It was a really valuable course and I learnt so much from it. This pen combines a few of the classes in one as well as being based on a programme (pizza order) that I built at the start of my JavaScript course at Indisoft.

**Thoughts**: Alongside the above I also continued with the Machine Learning course and at the day course learn the basics of PHP. I am really enjoying coding so much but finding the hour for 100DaysofCode for me is most useful for keeping on top of Documentation and keeping my projects in check - super valuable!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: At my daytime class I did alot of PHP on Udemy which felt good but shot my mind alittle. This afternoon I completed Machine Learning week 4 and started the codeacademy Data Science track. I also did a couple of Code war Kata today and a little freecode camp as mental breaks from the PHP.

**Thoughts** Intense day on PHP but very happy with the process! Also have split out a couple of features from my vocab trainer onto codepen so I can edit these features.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the PHP & SQL part of the course I was following and starting an example for a Book Club app I spent the afternoon adapting the Pong game I made last year into a Birthday gift for a friend. Link below. Working with the audio inside the loops was quite tricky and it is a little buggy but hopefully he likes it. As we're out to Dinner tonight and I have an appointment this afternoon I doubt I will get much more done but hope to do a little more code academy Data Science.

**Thoughts** Ok kind of slacked off working on this game for my friend but it was a little tricky in part and good to revisit old code to see how far I have come. I plan to move a few of my private Bitbucket Repos over to Github this weekend so I have more to show there.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:Today I put that PHP knowledge to practice, after transfering data from my JSON file to my database (see previous post) I started to manipulate the page and get some simple design elements in. St

Not feeling overly well so had a mid afternoon nap and read a little of Interactive Data Visualisation This evening I have been continuing through the code academy Data Science Beta track learning Matplotlib for python. 

**Thoughts** Pretty excited for the potential of the PHP I have learnt and being able to apply it to both the Book Club App I have started and my on going Vocab Trainer. I am debating trying to make the Book Club app using React also to demonstrate and practice those skills, I believe it will be a good (tough) challenge and give me a chance to showcase library use) Though I intend to keep the Vocab Trainer Vanilla JS.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most the afternoon trying to get Anaconda with python 3 and Jupyter Notebook running properly on my machine. At the last Meetup I went to I had a bit of a personal crisis as I had last minute updated or installed something which stopped me from being able to open Jupyter Notebook and therefore participate in the code along lecture on Unsupervised learning. However once I got this up and running I could put into practice the MatPlotLib classes from Codeacademy and draw some charts :)

**Thoughts** Feeling happy now after fixing this, but frustrated most of the afternoon, however the work has paid off. Now I'm going for a much earnt bath with my book!!

### Day 7: January 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I had a bit of a day off and took some time for chores and reading the Book for my Book Club. I did however complete the next section on the Codeacademy Data Science Track. 

**Thoughts** Week one complete! Feeling like I accomplished alot and looking forwards to the next 93 days :)
